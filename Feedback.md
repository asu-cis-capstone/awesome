### Feedback Points
 1. Make sure ads at the bottom of the page are responsive and look nice with mobile (contact page)
 2. Email form vs. link - user wanted email integration rather than form
 3. Client wanted an "Events Page" and functions
 4. Pricing needs to be pulled from the database, and not formatted into the HTML
 5. Content managmenet / backend needs to be developed
