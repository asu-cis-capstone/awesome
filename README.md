#Overview

The company we selected for our capstone project is called 'Blurred Lines' owned and managed by Wendy Armenta. Wendy is a barber who has recently started her own shop in Scottsdale and is seeking assistance in growing her business. Our team approached Wendy about her new business and discussed what we can offer in IT support for her growing business. After discussing her needs, we identified several areas that she would like to begin or expand upon with her new business. 

As a team, we identified five crucial components to this project. 

Website/Web Application
CRM (customer relationship management)
Tracking/Optimization
Social Media Integration
Establish backend data monitoring

The following waffle.io is our team project management task board. We will utilize this in order to ensure we efficiently prioritize tasks and meet deadlines.
